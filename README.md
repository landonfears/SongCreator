<h1>Song Creator</h1>
This simple app allows you to create songs with chords, and play them back. It was created on the back-end using Django with Tastypie REST API, and PostgreSQL database engine.  On the front-end, I used Backbone.js along with jQuery to manage views and events, as well as Bootstrap for look and feel. Finally, Audiolet.js was used to generate the sounds.
